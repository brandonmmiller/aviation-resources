            <h2>Training</h2>
            <p>The vaguest part of those requirements we discussed earlier is the “experience” portion. For the sake of a private pilot's license those requirements are outlined in 14 CFR 61.109(a) and simplified below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A MINIMUM of 40 hours of flight time</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>20 MUST be with an instructor</li>
                    <li>10 MUST be solo</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>5 hours of solo cross country</li>
                        <li>1 solo cross country of at LEAST 150 nautical miles with 3 full-stop landings at least 50 nautical miles apart</li>
                        <li>3 take-offs and landings at an airport with an operating control tower (ATC)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>3 hours MINIMUM cross-county (long distance) flying</li>
                    <li>3 hours MINIMUM of night training</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One night cross country over 100 nautical miles</li>
                        <li>10 FULL STOP take-offs and landings in the traffic pattern at an airport</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>3 hours MINIMUM of instrument training</li>
                    <li>3 hours MINIMUM of practical test prep within 2 calendar months of exam</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>It's important to be aware that the above outline is just a minimum of what MUST be completed for you to be eligible for your license. However, it is very rare for anyone to complete a pilot's license in the minimum 40 hours. Most trainees will take 60 to 70 hours or more depending on how often they train, how well they adapt to new material, how hard they study and prepare, and the training style of their CFI.</p>
            <h3>Where to Find a CFI</h3>
            <p>The best place by far to find a CFI is your local airport. Find a fixed base operator (FBO) at your local airport and give them a call, most either have a flight school at the airport itself or at least know of some local private instructors. An FBO is basically a mini airport terminal for small aircraft. It's a place where aircraft can get refueled and pilots can take a break and review flight planning materials. Establish a good relationship with your local FBO and it will become a valuable resource in your training experience. You can also use our friendly and easy to use contact form to be put in contact with a local CFI in your area.</p>
