            <p>Hello and welcome to our aviation information webpage. We're glad you've chosen to use us as a resource to help you begin your aviation journey. The intent of this webpage is to provide you with the basic information you need to make an informed decision about whether or not a general aviation (private pilot's) license is for you. If, upon reviewing the information we have provided to you, you decide that general aviation is for you, we will provide links and resources to help you get in contact with an FAA licensed flight instructor, also known as a CFI. Our website will also familiarize you with some of the more common aircraft that you may encounter. However, our webpage is not designed to replace a comprehensive FAA ground school education course. The information contained in this website is designed to be helpful in nature, and we do hope you will benefit from it, but no guarantee is made to its accuracy or currency. Throughout this website you may notices references to the US Code of Federal Regulation (CFR). This source is the ultimate authority on regulations over aviation and supersedes any information on this webpage. If you're confused on something we HIGHLY recommend you check there or reach out to your local FAA Flight Services District Office (FSDO).</p>
